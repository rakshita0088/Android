Use Case:

A car rental company wants notifications if the renter of a car drives at a speed above a given limit. The limit shall be set by the fleet company and it shall be possible for them to set the maximum permitted speed before  a rental period starts. It shall also be possible for different customers to have different maximum speeds set. 

If the set speed is exceeded, the rental company shall be notified and the user given a warning alert.

The first communication channel will happen through Firebase. It is possible that we will need an alternative communication channel to AWS as well though.

 

Implementation guidelines

It's expected to implement the project with Java or Kotlin
No need to build or run the project
Using a local git repo is merit
The implemented code must be presented during the interview
It's not required to use any specific 3rd party library. (You can put some comment in the places you need to call an API instead of calling the real one)
If something is not clear you go with your assumptions and share them with the code
No need to implement the UI part. Just an interface is enough
The Use Case should not take more than 3-4 hours coding
 
 
 In the sample project I have not called the Real time API's like Firebase and low level API's. Instead of that I added the comments like I am calling Firebase API or low level API.
